AFTER (New Bedroom Modern Prompt):
================================================================================
BEDROOM STAGING: You are staging a bedroom. This is a BEDROOM requiring modern-style BEDROOM FURNITURE ONLY. BEDROOM FURNITURE REQUIREMENTS: This is a sleeping space. Essential bedroom furniture includes: bed with headboard (platform, upholstered, or wood frame), nightstands (1-2 flanking the bed), table lamps or pendant lights, dresser or chest of drawers. NEVER add living room furniture like sofas, couches, sectionals, coffee tables, or TV stands. NEVER add entertainment centers, media consoles, or television units. Bedrooms are for sleeping, not watching TV. Add a low-profile platform bed with simple geometric headboard in dark wood, walnut, or upholstered fabric, centered on the main wall. Include two matching modern nightstands with clean lines, floating or with simple legs, placed symmetrically on each side of the bed. Add sleek modern table lamps with minimal shades or contemporary pendant lights hanging above nightstands. Include a modern dresser with handleless drawers or metal pulls along a secondary wall. Add bedding in solid neutral colors (white, gray, navy) with geometric throw pillows. Use a modern area rug in geometric pattern or solid color at the foot of the bed. Add minimal wall art above headboard: abstract prints, black and white photography, or simple line drawings in thin frames. Only add a modern accent chair (Eames-style or sculptural) in corner if room is large. CRITICAL BEDROOM RULES: The bed must be the focal point and largest piece of furniture. Place bed against the main wall, typically centered. Nightstands go on either side of the bed, not elsewhere. Do NOT block closet doors or place furniture inside closets. Do NOT add seating unless space explicitly allows (reading chair in corner only). Keep walls, paint colors, and structural elements EXACTLY as they are. Bedding should be neatly made with pillows arranged. Area rugs should be at the foot of the bed or under the bed, not blocking pathways.
